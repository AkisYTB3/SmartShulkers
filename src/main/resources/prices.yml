# Prices for items in Sell Shulkers
#
# Two formats are supported:
#
# 1. Per-item price:
#    MATERIAL_NAME: PRICE
#    Example: STONE: 0.5 - Makes each stone cost 0.5 currency
#
# 2. Stack/multiplier price:
#    MATERIAL_NAMExNUMBER: TOTAL_PRICE
#    Example: STONEx64: 32 - Makes each stone cost 0.5 currency (32/64)
#             DIAMONDx3: 300 - Makes each diamond cost 100 currency (300/3)
#
# The system will automatically calculate the per-item price
# Multiplier can be any positive number (x2, x64, x100, etc.)
#
# Notes:
# - Prices can be specified with either format
# - If both formats exist for same material, exact match takes priority
# - Set price to 0 or omit to disable selling an item
# - Use correct material names (all caps with underscores)
# - Decimal prices are supported (e.g., 0.25)
